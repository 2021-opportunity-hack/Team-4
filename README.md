## Control Alt Delete
Control Alt Delete helps people escape domestic violence. 99% of all clients are financially abused. We help with one time assistance with rent/utility/move in payments allowing the women we help to remain housed during this transition to independence. These Survivors have needed this help as they take control of their finances and futures.

## Problem Statement
Like many nonprofits, Control Alt Delete struggles to illustrate how a donation supports their mission of helping women to escape domestic violence.  The anonymity that Control Alt Delete maintains is necessary, but hurts their ability to collect grant funding which shifts their focus to fundraising to support their cause.  If they are able to make donations more tangible to donors through their website, social media, and even augmented reality, the hope is that they can increase the people they can support through increased donations.

ðŸ’°Requirements - Tangible Donations
Consider solutions that would have a broad impact first, like mobile, website, and social media innovations.  Since the consumer base is currently small for those using augmented reality or virtual reality, consider an innovation solution here only if you have a good solution for web, mobile, and social media first.

Solve the problem of adding tangibility for donations that would provide gas cards and hotel rooms first, then expand to other areas as directed by Laura and Control Alt Delete. Even the smallest amount of donations matter.

Create a way to gather some metrics around engagement of users using either Google Analytics or something similar to better understand how many people are using this solution.

Consider gamification as a method to increase the marketing footprint organically.  If people obtain a prize that can be shared over social media, this can create organic traffic to Control Alt Delete and ideally more donations.

Recommendations
Javascript game-based engines like PixiJS can help to create something that is interactable https://pixijs.com/ 

You may consider how to use AI to, for example, dynamically A/B test different approaches that would customize the donation experience depending on the user experience

Impact
Requests from prosecutor offices come in multiple times a day for this type of assistance. We help as we can based on funding and while what we have helped with is greatly appreciated it has not been 100% of the money that we need per survivor.
